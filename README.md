# image-optimizer-api

## Image optimizer REST API

POST /optimize accepts base64 image bytes and uses ImageMagick convert when configured. It returns optimized bytes and metadata.

This is a small reusable Python 3.11 service with no AI components and no runtime dependencies. It uses the standard library HTTP server so it can be copied into internal automation, extended, or deployed behind a reverse proxy.

## Run

```bash
python3 server.py
# listens on 0.0.0.0:8080
```

Send JSON requests with `Content-Type: application/json`. Every service exposes `GET /health`. See `tests/test_api.py` for request examples. External binaries are optional and are reported as clear `503`/`501` responses when not configured.

## Test

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
